# Generic Repository Pattern & Unit of Work with Entity Framework
## Overview
Welcome to this repository! In this project, we implement the **Generic Repository** Pattern and **Unit of Work** using **Entity Framework**. Additionally, we explore Entity Framework relationships such as:
- One-to-Many
- One-to-One
- Many-to-Many
## Benefits of Using This Pattern
Implementing the Generic Repository Pattern and Unit of Work provides the following advantages:
- Reduces code redundancy
- Encourages a consistent development pattern
- Minimizes potential errors
- Simplifies centralized data access logic maintenance
- FeaturesGeneric Repository Implementation
- Unit of Work Pattern
- Entity Framework Core Integration
- Entity Relationships Handling
- Scalable & Maintainable Architecture
## Getting StartedPrerequisitesEnsure you have the following installed:
- .NET Core SDK
- Entity Framework Core
- SQL Server (or any preferred database)
